About two and a half years ago [I wrote about moving on](/blog/2016/03/09/moving-on/) from my role at PayPal, a team I had been with for 3 years, build up a lot of experience at and met a lot of people at who I still call close friends to this day. 

At the time, I didn’t have a clear idea of what I would be doing next and my short terms goal was to “go do some contracting”. Oh, what an understatement that was.

Looking back it it now, it’s amazing to see how well things worked out in the last few years, both working on my own as [Work Betta](https://work.betta.io), as well as in my more recent collaboration with [Hoopy](https://hoopy.io). 

My move to contracting coincided with an increased interest in Developer Relations and Developer Experience (DX) by many companies young and old. Over time, I moved to focus more and more on DX, a topic close to my heart even during my time at PayPal.

Mid last year I teamed up with the team at [Hoopy](https://hoopy.io). The goal was to be able to extend my focus on DX and to be able to take on bigger, bolder projects as a team. At Hoopy I was able to help many new exciting clients, as well as solve the loneliness of being an independent contractor. 

It’s been amazing working with this cool team. Thank you, Matthew Revell, for trusting me to represent the Hoopy brand all this time.

Yet, still, it’s time to move on. Again.

## What am I up to next?

On August 13 I will be joining [Box](https://box.com) as their European developer advocate for their API platform. Their developer relations activities are relatively new and the team is headed up by Jonathan LeBlanc with whom I enjoyed working at PayPal. 

The [Box API platform](https://developer.box.com) is an exciting platform when you care about a secure and compliant data sharing and collaboration, yet also want to make use of modern machine learning technologies. In light of recent global events, data security and compliance have definitely peaked my interests and therefore this opportunity was too good to ignore.

If you’re a Box platform developer, I look forward to working with you to improve the platform in the next few months. If you’ve been one of my clients over the last years, I thank you for your continued confidence and support. 

[Hoopy](https://hoopy.io) is still growing, both hiring new people to the team and bringing on new clients. Don’t hesitate to [reach out to them](mailto:hello@hoopy.io) for any developer relations or developer experience work in the future. I will stay on for the foreseeable future as an Associate Consultant to help with the transition. 

If you want to chat with me about [Box](https://box.com), [Hoopy](https://hoopy.io), DevRel, DX, or anything else, free to email me on [cristiano@betta.io](mailto:cristiano@betta.io) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cbetta).
