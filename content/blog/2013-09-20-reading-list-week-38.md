I thought I'd get back into blogging again so let's start with a simple reading list. Here's some articles that have kept me busy over the past week and I'd think people ight enjoy.


* Pete Keen has a short list of [Essential Tools for Starting a Rails App in 2013](http://www.petekeen.net/essential-tools-for-starting-a-rails-app-in-2013). I knew most of them but there were a few I didn't yet.
* Lindsey Bieda has a nice article explaining how to add a [nice configuration method and generator](http://rarlindseysmash.com/posts/config-and-generators-in-gems) to your Ruby Gem. I need to add this to my next Gem.
* The great guys at GlobalDev are doing a series of RubyTips. As a big proponent for short, concise and well structured code I think there's a few amazing gems (no pun intended) in there. ([Part 1](http://globaldev.co.uk/2013/09/ruby-tips-part-1/), [Part 2](http://globaldev.co.uk/2013/09/ruby-tips-part-2/))
* My colleague Tim has been working on a series explaining how to use the new REST APIs in NodeJS. The firs 2 parts are available now ([Part 1](https://devblog.paypal.com/building-a-node-and-paypal-app/), [Part 2](https://devblog.paypal.com/building-a-web-app-with-node-js-the-paypal-sdk-part-2/)). I need to do this myself to get the hang of NodeJS a bit more.
* [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) is a Ruby-like language that compiles down to C. Sounds to good to be true and I need to play with this stat!
* There is now an app to teach you [arbitrary Ruby trivia](http://iconoclastlabs.github.io/rubytrivia/).
