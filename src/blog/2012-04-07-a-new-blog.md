It has been a while since I last blogged, and to be fair I've been kinda busy, but I also was frustrated with my old blog. It was bloated and heavy to load, all mainly due to Wordpress and Site5's shared hosting. Wordpress started as a nice blogging platform but lately it has been pissing me off (more on this), and I realised that running a whole PHP script for pages that barely ever change is stupid.

So here is the new blog. The old one is still available [here](http://blog.cristianobetta.com/) as a static HTML archive (hence why it loads so fast).

This new blog is built using [Octopress](http://octopress.org), which is a "blog aware static site generator". Basically what it does is convert a whole folder of template files and blog posts written in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) into a whole folder of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've been using a few simple frameworks like [Nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for work and event management recently and I loved the speed. No database and no server side scripting results in super fast load times, combing that with the hosting on [Github](http://pages.github.com) (see here to learn how to do this yourself) makes it even faster.

But let's quit talking about the technical details of my blog, or maybe not. I definitely want to share some more techie things here, highlight some of the code I personally write, workflows we use at [EmberAds](http://emberads.com/), and software I love using. Although it's fun to blog about anything at random, I rather make this blog a bit more topical (hence the cheesy title).
