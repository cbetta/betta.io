One of the problems I keep running into with Puppet is that the packages I'm trying to install are very new and I need to run `apt-get update` to update the repositories. Because Puppet does not run scripts it gets rather annoying to get the update to run before you install any packages.

I found a lot of solutions around the web but this one seems to work best for me.

```puppet
stage { 'preinstall':
  before => Stage['main']
}

class apt_get_update {
  exec { 'apt-get -y update': }
}

class { 'apt_get_update':
  stage => preinstall
}
```
