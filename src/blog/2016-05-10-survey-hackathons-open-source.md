>  TL;DR - I ran a Twitter Poll with interesting but insignificant results. Now I'm running a more extensive survey to see if I can get some more results. ~~You should fill in the survey!~~

I ran a Twitter Poll last week asking people about their involvement in Open Source.

> Quick poll. Do you go to hackathons? And do you contribute to Open Source (OS) in any way?

I'm really happy with the 426 responses I got! Thank you all! The results proved quite interesting and I noticed a few things:

* Of my respondents about 70%+ contributed to Open Source, **independent of whether they attended hackathons**.
* The people who contributed to Open Source were split **about 50/50** between the hackers and the non hackers.

In other words: there is not much of a correlation between hackathons and open source software (based on this poll).

A few added some notes to their response:

> [@cbetta](https://twitter.com/cbetta) voted but for some more detail: I do a lot of OS work, I donâ€™t like hackdays as they are competitive and stressful

> [@cbetta](https://twitter.com/cbetta) Only for work (hackathons). Yes.

> [@cbetta](https://twitter.com/cbetta) [@jesslynnrose](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose) Last commercial hackathon we participated in we github'd everything during the event so it'd be OSS'd before judging.

In the end I feel the poll left more questions than it provided answers to. Therefore I ~~am now running~~ ran a longer survey to answer some of these:

* Do people **think** hackathons influenced them to do Open Source?
* Why do people contribute to Open Source?
* How do they mostly contribute to Open Source?
* What is stopping people from contributing to Open Source?

The survey is closed now closed now ~~will be open until the end of June. I'd love your entry even if you don't do hackathons or Open Source~~!
