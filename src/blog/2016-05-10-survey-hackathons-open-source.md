>  TL;DR - I ran a Twitter Poll with interesting but insignificant results. Now I'm running a more extensive survey to see if I can get some more results. <strike>You should fill in the survey!</strike>

I ran a Twitter Poll last week asking people about their involvement in Open Source.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Quick poll. Do you go to hackathons? And do you contribute to Open Source (OS) in any way?

I'm really happy with the 426 responses I got! Thank you all! The results proved quite interesting and I noticed a few things:

* Of my respondents about 70%+ contributed to Open Source, **independent of whether they attended hackathons**.
* The people who contributed to Open Source were split **about 50/50** between the hackers and the non hackers.

In other words: there is not much of a correlation between hackathons and open source software (based on this poll).



A few added some notes to their response:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cbetta">@cbetta</a> voted but for some more detail: I do a lot of OS work, I donâ€™t like hackdays as they are competitive and stressful</p>&mdash; 01101000 01101001 (@Charlotteis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Charlotteis/status/728590824959836161">May 6, 2016</a>

In the end I feel the poll left more questions than it provided answers to. Therefore I <strike>am now running</strike> ran a longer survey to answer some of these:

* Do people **think** hackathons influenced them to do Open Source?
* Why do people contribute to Open Source?
* How do they mostly contribute to Open Source?
* What is stopping people from contributing to Open Source?

The survey is closed now closed now <strike>will be open until the end of June. I'd love your entry even if you don't do hackathons or Open Source</strike>!
